The best submission was with the accuracy of 0.82296 (Ignore it please), 
We used the MICE recursive algorithm to predict missing age values.
We did not use this at the end, because it was too advanced
and we do not know how it works.
So we sticked with a more simple method with mean and standard deviation.

The final best prediction was with the accuracy of: 0.80861
Using Condition inference tree Random Forest.
The rank ranges within the places: ( 598 - 807 )
